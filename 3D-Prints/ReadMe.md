This directory contains the custom parts for each remote lab that were 3D printed using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) on Prusa printers.

Ideally every part would be documented with its Fusion360 file, .STL file, .gCode for PrusaMini printers with 0.4mm nozzle and a photo of the final part both alone and in its context in the setup.

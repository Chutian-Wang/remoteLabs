Atomic Spectroscopy has 12 Fusion 360 files
	

Atomic Spectroscopy was the first lab to heavily use 3D printed parts for a complicated assembly. Thus, its files are disjointed and not well organized. It has also had the most revisions over time. There are many files for individual components instead of a streamlined assembly like Diffrac or Gamma.

Deborah Notes: 

CarouselTop - anchors an encoded motor atop the carousel with its axis positioned vertically and the microcontroller off to the side.

CarouselArm - connects the motor shaft to the lamp turret

Diffraction Interference has 3 primary Fusion 360 files:
	Mounting System Version 3
	Track Center and Guide
	Direct Drive Slit Mount

The fourth file, Track Screen Mount, is generally used in the in-person lab to mount screens, phones, cameras, to the DI track. This file is also available to serve as a general template for mounting things to the DI Track.

The DI lab consists of 2 main parts mounted on one optics rail. The first part is the laser and slit assemblies. This section allows us to control the laser and the particular slit through which the laser passes. All files for this are in the 'Direct Drive Slit Mount' Fusion 360 file. This Direct Drive system interfaces with stepper motors and requires mounting hardware. The second part is the moving stage with the screen/camera mounting system. The guides that help center and level the stage are found in the 'Track Center and Guide' Fusion 360 file. The 'Mounting System Version 3' fusion file contains everything that mounts to the moving stage. This contains the screen mounting frame, the rear camera mount, and a mount for a downwards facing camera used to measure the distance between the screen and the slits. This system requires 1/4 inch rods and mounting screws. 

Mounting System Version 3
	This file includes the entire assembly on top of the moving stage. 
	- Screen Frame Front
	- Screen Frame Back
	- Tape Camera Bottom
	- Tape Camera Top
	- Horizontal Dovetail Camera Mount
	- Horizontal Dovetail Rod Mount

Track Center and Guide
	Contains only two relevant pieces, one to center the stage on the optics rail, and the second to center and support the stage off the end of the optics rail at the correct height. 
	- Stage Guide
	- Stage Table Mount
	
Direct Drive Slit Mount
	Contains mounting pieces needed to direct drive mount the stepper motors to the diffraction wheels on the optics rail mounts. Also includes identifying rings for each slit wheel useful for calibration and visualizing position. The final relevant pieces are the guides for the wheels, these turned out to be unnecessary 
	- Direct Drive Motor Junction
	- Direct Drive Motor Mount
	- Labeled DS Ring
	- Labeled SS Ring


Deborah Notes: 

StageMount - anchors the screen to the translation stage.

ScreenFrame - holds switchable plastic screen.

Gamma Radiation has 5 primary Fusion 360 files:
	GR T-Slot Frame Brackets
	Stage Mount
	Shielding Holder
	Absorber Mounts
	Servo Actuator Mount

The GR lab consists of 3 main parts: the T-Slot frame, shielding/source holder assembly, and the servo actuator assembly. The GR T-Slot frame files are all usable in any T-Slot assembly, however, they were designed for the gamma lab. The stage mount is specifically designed to mount the linear moving stage to T-Slot cross bars. The shielding holder simply holds all of the absorbers and sources  as well as includes a tapered frame to increase success when loading into the counter. The Absorber Mounts file includes past versions of the frames as separate components. The frame gap can be adjusted using the parameter "FrameIndent". Servo Actuator Mount is the complex assembly that grabs the absorbers and loads them into the counter.

Franck Hertz has 5 Fusion 360 files:
	DCV Clip
	FH Pulley
	L Bracket
	Variac Idler
	Variac Pulley

The Franck Hertz lab does not have a well defined print repository like other labs. It was the first lab to be remotified and was mostly done manually. It should get a complete 3D printed redesign, particularly for the motors. Thus, all the files are somewhat disjointed.
